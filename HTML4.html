    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>
        Several influences contributed to the development of the gamebook format during the twentieth century. The possibility of
        having stories branching out into several different paths seems to have been first suggested by Jorge Luis Borges in his
        short story An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain (1941). This story features an author whose novel is a three-part
        story containing two branch points, and with nine possible endings. Another story by Borges, titled "The Garden of Forking
        Paths"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths"> [clickforlink]</a> (1941), also describes a book with a maze-like narrative reminiscent of modern gamebooks. These stories, however,
        did not carry out the idea of branching-path narrative to full execution.
